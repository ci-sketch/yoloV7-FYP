How to run the code on the photo and how to run the code on video? You may use either Google Collab or Jupyter Notebook for ease.
The script contains the following code:
1.	Importing Important Libraries:
import torch
#from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
import cv2
2.	Download the YOLOv7 model for transfer learning on custom dataset. Please note yoloV7-FYP will already have executed experiments in the runs folder.
!git clone https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7 OR https://github.com/ci-sketch/yoloV7-FYP
3.	Verify the current directory
cd yolov7
4.	Run the evaluation for Test Images.
# Run evaluation for Image
!python detect.py --weights best.pt --conf 0.3 --source test\
Note: Copy best.pt and test image folder into C:\Users\YOURPCNAME\yolov7
5.	Display Detected Images
#display inference on ALL test images
import glob
from IPython.display import Image, display
i = 0
limit = 10000 # max images to print
#Keep checking exp folder placed in C:\Users\YOURPCNAME\yolov7\runs\detect\ after each detection the exp value will change so you need to put latest exp value in the code.
for imageName in glob.glob('runs\detect\exp\*.jpg'): #assuming JPG
    if i < limit:
      display(Image(filename=imageName))
      print("\n")
    i = i + 1
6.	For Video
# Run evaluation for Video
# replace sample.mp4 with your video and do not forget to upload that video yolov7 directory.
!python detect.py --weights best.pt --conf 0.25 --source sample.mp4
